    Attributes
    ----------
    function : function
        function describing the boundaries. Given the coordinates of a point 
        the function returns a True value if the point respect the bouddaries, 
        False otherwise
    inside_points : set
        dictionary with the coordinates of the points that respects the boundaries
    boundary_points : set
        dictionary with the coordinates of the points that do not respects the
        boundaries and are at a distance of 1 step form the closest inside point
    closest_boundary : dict
        dictionary with inside points coordinates as keys and their closest 
        boundary point coordinates and the relative distance as values


    Methods
